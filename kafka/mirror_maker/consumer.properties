# Mirroring is often used in cross-DC scenarios, and there are a few configuration options that you may want to tune
# to help deal with inter-DC communication latencies and performance bottlenecks on your specific hardware. In general,
# you should set a high value for the socket buffer size on the mirror-maker's consumer configuration (socket.buffersize)
# and the source cluster's broker configuration (socket.send.buffer).
# Also, the mirror-maker consumer's fetch size (fetch.size) should be higher than the consumer's socket buffer size.

# socket buffer size
#socket.receive.buffer.bytes=65536

# consumer fetch size. It should be euqal the maximum available size of one message
#fetch.message.max.bytes=307200
